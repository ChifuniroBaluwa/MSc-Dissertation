## Abstract
Cholera remains a significant public health challenge in Malawi, particularly in rapidly urbanizing areas. This study aimed to provide a spatial understanding of cholera in Blantyre district by (1) identifying and visualizing cholera hotspots, and (2) examining potential factors that could explain the observed patterns. Utilizing a unique dataset of village-level cholera cases (n=7,700) from 2022-2023, the research employed Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) and Getis-Ord Gi* statistic to visualize disease clustering. Ecological regression analysis investigated associations between Traditional Authority (TA) socioeconomic indicators and cholera rates.

Results revealed pronounced spatial heterogeneity in cholera distribution, with significant hotspots concentrated in southeastern Blantyre, corresponding to urban areas. Ecological regression analysis found a negative association between population density and cholera incidence, while Ventilated Improved Pit (VIP) latrine coverage showed a positive association. These findings highlight the complex dynamics of cholera transmission in urban environments.

The study demonstrates the utility of fine-scale spatial analysis in understanding local cholera transmission patterns. However, the ecological nature of the socioeconomic analysis limits causal inference. Future research should prioritize village-level socioeconomic data collection, integrate environmental factors, and conduct longitudinal studies to better capture temporal dynamics. Findings underscore the need for targeted interventions in urban hotspots and a nuanced approach to sanitation improvements, focusing on proper use and maintenance rather than coverage alone.

This research was constrained by data availability, particularly the mismatch between village-level disease data and TA-level socioeconomic indicators. Despite these limitations, the study provides valuable insights for cholera control efforts in Blantyre and similar urban settings in developing countries.
